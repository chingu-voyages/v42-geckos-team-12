Ever wondered which Hogwarts dorm you belong to? This little APP lets you know just that! 
Would you be helping Harry uncover all the secrets of Hogwarts, or would you be doing everything in your power to stop him alongside Draco?

## Overview
This project was built by a team of four during voyage 42 at [chingu.io](https://www.chingu.io/).
The team did everything from deciding on what to build, what tech stack to use, the design and, of course, the execution.
During the 6 week period of the voyage, the team had at least one meeting each week to review the past week and to prepare for the sprint in the coming week.
